# Engine-STG

STG from scratch.

Someone could complie the STG Engine and get it run. However someone still needs the game data such as charactor define, level define and sprites sheet, etc. to run the real game. Engine use some custom data structure, but someone still could rewrite ResourceManager class to use others.

This is not a general STG engine, and still under development.
